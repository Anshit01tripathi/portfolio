Hello! I'm Anshit Tripathi, a B.Tech student from Gonda, Uttar Pradesh, India, currently pursuing Computer Science and Engineering at GL Bajaj Institute of Technology and Management.

Passionate about software development and web technologies, I strive to expand my knowledge and skills in the field. With a focus on problem-solving and a strong foundation in programming, I actively participate in coding competitions and collaborative projects.

This website serves as a platform to showcase my portfolio and projects. Whether you're a fellow student, an employer, or simply interested in computer science, I invite you to explore my work and connect with me.

Thank you for visiting, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any inquiries or exciting opportunities to collaborate.</p2>
